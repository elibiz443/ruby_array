# Ruby Test

*Write code to change this array:
```
["B$u$i$ld", "$t$$h$e", "N$e$x$t", "E$$ra", "$$o$f$", "S$$of$t$wa$r$e", "De$$ve$l$op$me$n$t"] 
```
to be:
```
"BUILD THE NEXT ERA OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT" 
```
as string in simplest way in Ruby.

To test, run this in terminal:
```
rspec spec
```

#### Voilà 👍
